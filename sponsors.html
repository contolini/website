    <h2 class="mt3">NodeConf Oakland Sponsorship</h2>
    <p class="mb4">NodeConf is the longest running conference for the Node community. Now in our 5th year NodeConf promises to remain a leader in community driven events.</p>

    <h2 class="mt3">NodeConf 2015</h2>
    <p class="mb4">NodeConf 2015 is our most ambitious event yet. We'll be doing a full speaker series in the historic Fox Theatre with room for over a thousand attendees and a musical director creating and performing a live sound score to assist the transitions between speakers. We're also running concurrent evening events across Oakland.</p>

    <h2 class="m3">Diversity Giveaway</h2>
    <p class="mb4">We are offering diversity ticket giveaways as part of NodeConf. Every sponsorship includes some number of tickets given away as part of your sponsorship. Leading up to the conference we will select applicants for the giveaway and give out tickets in batches associated with each sponsor.</p>

    <h2 class="mt3">NodeConf Adventure</h2>
    <p class="mb4">The word most often used to describe Walker Creek Ranch is "magical." This will be the 6th year we've run an event there. In the earliest days of Node we did un-conferences called "NodeConf SummerCamp" which were collaborative events where Node leaders talked through the future of the project. In recent years we've used the venue to provide more "hands-on" learning and community building which helped create and grow NodeSchool.</p>
    <p>NodeConf Adventure is the latest in our hands-on series. It is a family friendly event that invites a large portion of the Node community leadership to work together in a relaxed environment.</p>
